    "# 1. Introduction: The Recommendation Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🤔 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you run a video streaming service with **10,000 movies**. A new user signs up and watches just 5 movies. **How do you recommend the 6th movie?**\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 The Insight\n",
    "\n",
    "**Collaborative Filtering** makes recommendations based on patterns in what people like:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Two Main Approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. User-Based: \"People like you also liked...\"**\n",
    "- Find users with similar taste to yours\n",
    "- Recommend movies they enjoyed\n",
    "- *Amazon uses this*: \"Customers who bought this also bought...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Item-Based: \"If you liked this, you'll like...\"**\n",
    "- Find movies similar to ones you liked\n",
    "- Recommend those similar movies  \n",
    "- *Netflix uses this*: \"Because you watched The Godfather...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌟 Real-World Impact\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Netflix:** 75% of viewing comes from recommendations\n",
    "- **Amazon:** 35% of revenue driven by recommendations\n",
    "- **Spotify:** 40% of discoveries through personalized playlists\n",

    "## 🎓 Why Item-Based CF Works\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Psychology:\n",
    "- **Transitive preferences:** If you like A and B, and B is similar to C, you'll probably like C\n",
    "- **Genre consistency:** Action fans like action movies, drama fans like drama\n",
    "- **Quality signals:** Good movies share similar quality indicators\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Statistics:\n",
    "- **Item correlation:** Movies rated similarly by users are related\n",
    "- **Clustering:** Items naturally cluster by genre, style, quality\n",
    "- **Stable patterns:** Item relationships change slowly (unlike user tastes)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strengths:\n",
    "✓ **Fast:** Pre-compute item similarities once, reuse for all users\n",
    "✓ **Scalable:** More users = better similarity estimates\n",
    "✓ **Stable:** Movie relationships don't change often\n",
    "✓ **Explainable:** \"Because you watched X\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Weaknesses:\n",
    "✗ Cold start for new items (no ratings yet)\n",
    "✗ Limited serendipity (recommends similar, not diverse)\n",
    "✗ Popularity bias (popular items dominate)\n",
