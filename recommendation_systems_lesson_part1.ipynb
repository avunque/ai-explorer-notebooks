    "## 🤔 The Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you run a video streaming service with **10,000 movies**. A new user signs up and watches just 5 movies. **How do you recommend the 6th movie?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Challenges:\n",
    "- Too many choices → users feel overwhelmed\n",
    "- Users don't know what they want → need discovery\n",
    "- Each user is unique → need personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "## 💡 The Solution: Collaborative Filtering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Core Idea:** \"People who agreed in the past tend to agree in the future\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### User-Based Approach: \"People like you also liked...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Find users with similar taste to yours\n",
    "2. Look at movies they enjoyed\n",
    "3. Recommend those movies to you\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- Amazon: \"Customers who bought this also bought...\"\n",
    "- Spotify: \"Fans of this artist also listen to...\"\n",

    "**Concepts:**\n",
    "- Recommendation systems solve the problem of choice overload\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering uses patterns in user behavior\n",
    "- User-based CF: \"People like you also liked...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Technical Skills:**\n",
    "- Created user-item matrix from transaction data\n",
    "- Calculated user-user similarity with cosine similarity\n",
    "- Implemented complete user-based recommendation algorithm\n",
    "- Generated personalized recommendations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "- Sparsity is a major challenge (users rate <1% of items)\n",
    "- Similarity metrics capture \"similar taste\"\n",
    "- Weighted averaging gives better predictions\n",
