    "- Too many choices ‚Üí users feel overwhelmed\n",

    "### User-Based Approach: \"People like you also liked...\"\n",

    "1. Find users with similar taste to yours\n",
    "2. Look at movies they enjoyed\n",
    "3. Recommend those movies to you\n",

    "**Concepts:**\n",
    "- Recommendation systems solve the problem of choice overload\n",
    "- Collaborative filtering uses patterns in user behavior\n",
    "- User-based CF: \"People like you also liked...\"\n",

    "- Created user-item matrix from transaction data\n",
    "- Calculated user-user similarity with cosine similarity\n",
    "- Implemented complete user-based recommendation algorithm\n",
    "- Generated personalized recommendations\n",
